                                1.3 [Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Company shall have the right collect and
                                analyze data and other information relating to the provision, use and performance of
                                various aspects of the Services and related systems and technologies (including, without
                                limitation, information concerning Customer Data and data derived therefrom), and
                                Company will be free (during and after the term hereof) to (i) use such information and
                                data to improve and enhance the Services and for other development, diagnostic and
                                corrective purposes in connection with the Services and other Company offerings, and
                                (ii) disclose such data solely in aggregate or other de-identified form in connection
                                with its business.] No rights or licenses are granted except as expressly set forth
                                herein.</p>

                            <p class="font-weight-bold">PAYMENT OF FEES</p>
                            <p class="">1.1 Customer will pay Company the then applicable fees described in the Order
                                Form for the Services and Implementation Services in accordance with the terms therein
                                (the “Fees”). If Customer’s use of the Services exceeds the Service Capacity set forth
                                on the Order Form or otherwise requires the payment of additional fees (per the terms of
                                this Agreement), Customer shall be billed for such usage and Customer agrees to pay the
                                additional fees in the manner provided herein. Company reserves the right to change the
                                Fees or applicable charges and to institute new charges and Fees at the end of the
                                Initial Service Term or the current renewal term, upon thirty (30) days prior notice to
                                Customer (which may be sent by email). If Customer believes that Company has billed
                                Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact Company no later than 60 days after the
                                closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in
                                order to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to Company’s
                                customer support department.<br><br>

                                1.2 Company may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for
                                invoices issued in any given month must be received by Company thirty (30) days after
                                the mailing date of the invoice. Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5%
                                per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is
                                lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of
                                Service. Customer shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services other than
                                U.S. taxes based on Company’s net income.
                            </p>

                            <p class="font-weight-bold">TERM AND TERMINATION</p>
                            <p class="">2.1 Subject to earlier termination as provided below, this Agreement is for the
                                Initial Service Term as specified in the Order Form.<br><br>

                                2.2 In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party may also terminate this
                                Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ notice (or without notice in the case of nonpayment),
                                if the other party materially breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.
                                Customer will pay in full for the Services up to and including the last day on which the
                                Services are provided. All sections of this Agreement which by their nature should
                                survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, accrued
                                rights to payment, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of
                                liability.<br><br>

                            <p class="font-weight-bold">WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER</p>
                            <p class="">Company shall use reasonable efforts consistent with prevailing industry
                                standards to maintain the Services in a manner which minimizes errors and interruptions
                                in the Services and shall perform the Implementation Services in a professional and
                                workmanlike manner. Services may be temporarily unavailable for scheduled maintenance or
                                for unscheduled emergency maintenance, either by Company or by third-party providers, or
                                because of other causes beyond Company’s reasonable control, but Company shall use
                                reasonable efforts to provide advance notice in writing or by e-mail of any scheduled
                                service disruption. HOWEVER, COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE
                                UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE; NOR DOES IT MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE
                                OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICES. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE
                                SERVICES AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL
                                WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                                MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

                            <p class="font-weight-bold">INDEMNITY</p>
                            <p class="">Company shall hold Customer harmless from liability to third parties resulting
                                from infringement by the Service of any United States patent or any copyright or
                                misappropriation of any trade secret, provided Company is promptly notified of any and
                                all threats, claims and proceedings related thereto and given reasonable assistance and
                                the opportunity to assume sole control over defense and settlement; Company will not be
                                responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing. The foregoing obligations
                                do not apply with respect to portions or components of the Service (i) not supplied by
                                Company, (ii) made in whole or in part in accordance with Customer specifications, (iii)
                                that are modified after delivery by Company, (iv) combined with other products,
                                processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (v)
                                where Customer continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or
                                after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement,
                                or (vi) where Customer’s use of the Service is not strictly in accordance with this
                                Agreement. If, due to a claim of infringement, the Services are held by a court of
                                competent jurisdiction to be or are believed by Company to be infringing, Company may,
                                at its option and expense (a) replace or modify the Service to be non-infringing
                                provided that such modification or replacement contains substantially similar features
                                and functionality, (b) obtain for Customer a license to continue using the Service, or
                                (c) if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate this Agreement
                                and Customer’s rights hereunder and provide Customer a refund of any prepaid, unused
                                fees for the Service.</p>
